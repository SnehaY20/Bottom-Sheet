# Bottom Sheet App

This project is a React implementation of a **Bottom Sheet** component. The bottom sheet is a sliding panel that can be dragged or snapped to different positions (fully open, half open, or closed). It uses `useRef`, `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useMemo` hooks in React to handle state and dynamic updates.

## Features

- A draggable bottom sheet that can be opened and closed.
- Snap points for different states: fully open, half-open, and closed.
- The bottom sheet can be interacted with using mouse and touch events.
- Smooth transitions between snap points.
- Responsive to different screen sizes.
